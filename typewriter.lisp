;;; CURSOR SECTION -------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; There are two categories of cursor in this program: text and screen cursors.
;;
;; Text cursors are used to identify the point in a page that will be affected
;; by user input. In this program the page moves rather than the cursor, so text
;; cursors do not move across the screen like traditional cursors.
;;
;; There is also a single screen cursor, which is handled by ncurses and moves
;; across the screen during draw operations, but is effectively always located
;; at the center of the screen from the user's perspective.
