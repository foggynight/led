# led: Vision Document

## Introduction

**led** aims to simulate the experience of using a typewriter, from within a
computer terminal.

## History

This project was started with a line editor similar to **ed** in mind, but has
changed direction. I want a typewriter for functional use, but am finding them
hard to find; so I'm writing a program to replace a physical typewriter.

## System Features

- Text preview and editing
- Pages to represent text files
- Cursor centered horizontally near the bottom of the screen
- Sliding view while typing to simulate a moving page
- Auto formatting features such as those for a letter

## Challenges

## Stakeholders and Interests

## Users and User Goals
