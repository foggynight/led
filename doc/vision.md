## Introduction

Typewriter inspired text editor

This project was started with a line editor similar to UNIX ed in mind, but
has changed direction.

I want a typewriter for functional use, but I can't find one. I'm going to
write a program to simulate using one instead.

## System Features

- Text preview and editing
- Pages to represent text files
- Cursor centered horizontally near the bottom of the screen
- Sliding view while typing to simulate a moving page
- Auto formatting features such as those for a letter
