## Usage

### Commands

**Format:** `[LINE]COMMAND[COUNT]`

- `LINE`: Target line number
- `COMMAND`: Command to execute
- `COUNT`: Number of times to execute

By default, a command is executed 1 time on the current line.

Including a target line sets the current line to that target before
executing a command. Commands that act on a line will increment the
line number after being executed.

Commands that modify the line buffer may be repeated using count.
Repeating a command will cause the line number to be incremented
between executions.

### Command List

- `f` - file: Open or create a file
- `v` - view: Print the whole line buffer
- `r` - read: Print the current line
- `l` - line: Print the current line number
- `s` - setline: Set the current line
- `i` - insert: Insert text before the current line
- `a` - append: Append text after the current line
- `c` - change: Replace text at the given line
- `w` - write: Write line buffer to the current file
- `q` - exit: Exit the program
