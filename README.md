## Usage

### Commands

**Format:** [LINE]COMMAND[COUNT]

- LINE: Target line
- COMMAND: Command to execute
- COUNT: Number of times to execute

By default, a command is executed 1 time on the current line.

Including a target line sets the current line to that target before
executing a command. Commands that act on a line will increment the
line number after being executed.

Commands that modify the line buffer may be repeated using count.
Repeating a command will cause the line number to be incremented
between executions.
